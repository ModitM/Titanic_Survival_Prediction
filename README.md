## Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a given passenger (in test.csv file) will survive or not based on the learning from the train.csv file. For the same, I have used a Logistic Regression model 
to carry out the classification and prediction. The output of the project is present in titanic_submission.csv file, where 0 represents non-survival and 1 represents survival of the passenger.
